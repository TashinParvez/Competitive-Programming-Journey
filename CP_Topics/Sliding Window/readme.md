# Sliding Window Technique
- Fixed Size and Variable size

## Notes
- Sliding window is best suited for problems that involve contiguous subarrays or substrings.
- The technique can have variations such as dynamic window size or two-pointer sliding.
- Be cautious of edge cases where the window size becomes important for efficiency or correctness.

## Time Complexity
- Convert O(n*n)  ->  O(n)
