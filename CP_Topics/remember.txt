GCD / LCM = Number Theory
Factorial / nCr / Large Modulo = Combinatorics / Modulo Inverse
Parity (Even/Odd), XOR = Bit Manipulation


Think Brute Force
Think solution in reverse order


SubArray / Continuous / SubSegment = Prefix Sum
Sliding Window / Two Pointers = Optimization for Subarrays


Sorted / Monotonic = Binary Search
Smallest / Largest / K-th = Sorting / Heap / Binary Search

Intervals / Merging / Overlapping = Sorting / Sweep Line

Count / Frequency = Hashing / Map

Think DP [check constraints carefully]
Check base cases for DP and prove solution for Greedy
Take / Not Take = DP

Choices / Paths / Sequences = Backtracking


Think Graph
Adjacency / Connectivity = Graph / BFS / DFS
Distances / Shortest Path = Dijkstra / BFS


Cycles / Components = Graph / DSU
