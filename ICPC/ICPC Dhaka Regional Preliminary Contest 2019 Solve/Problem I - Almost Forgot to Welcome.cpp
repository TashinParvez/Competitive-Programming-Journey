/*
 ICPC Dhaka Regional is the biggest programming competition in Bangladesh. Also the most anticipated one
as well. Students from all the different universities storm their brains all year in preparation for this
competition. You are now taking part in this competition, so a big congratulations to you.
Dhaka site is one of the biggest sites in ICPC. This year almost 1800 teams are participating in the
competition. So in celebration, we are going to give you an easy problem to solve.
You have to write a program, which will print the line “Welcome to ICPC Dhaka Regional Online Preliminary
Contest, 2019” (without quotes).
Note: you can’t output anything other than the required output, and the line must end with a newline (‘\n’).
Take special care about spelling and case. If you alter any of those, you may not get accepted.
For your convenience, we are providing one sample program in C/C++ which prints “Bangladesh”. You just
have to change the code to your requirement.
