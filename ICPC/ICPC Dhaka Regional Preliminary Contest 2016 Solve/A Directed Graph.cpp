/*
Some people often ask what is the real-life usage of algorithm. There are tons of such usages and one
popped up in the following real life scenario.
One day Alpha, Beta and Gamma went for dinner. When the bill came, we saw Alpha is charged with
23 takas, Beta with 21 takas and Gamma with 24 takas. So, Alpha gave 20 takas to Beta and Beta does
not mind paying 3 takas out of his pocket for Alpha. Other than these 3 takas, Beta will pay for himself
and also for Gamma. So, Beta gave 100 takas to Gamma and asked Gamma to pay to the restaurant
boy. However, after a while, Beta said- “Hey Alpha, why don’t you pay for Gamma today. And for my
meal, here is the 20 takas, I guess you won’t mind paying the rest.” Alpha agreed to the proposal (and
paid the restaurant) and Beta took the 100 takas back from Gamma.
