/*
Coldplay is my absolutely favorite band. I love
Chris Martin. Not only as a singer, but also as a
person. He is so down to earth despite being so
famous. I think he is absolutely amazing.
The most amazing thing about Coldplay is that
despite listening to them all the time, I often
stumble on a song of them which I never heard
and which turns out to be amazing as well.
Not only do they have great songs, their videos are
great as well. You can feel that they put great thought behind each of them. I especially like the video
of “Up&Up”,
