/*
COVID - 19 has been the most prominent topic in our lives for the last year. Just when some of us thought
that the pandemic was under our control, we are going through another huge increase in infection rate.
There is still very little data to predict what is going to happen with this virus. So as general people we
should really listen to the experts. We should wear a mask whenever we are interacting with another
person. We should avoid unnecessary movements completely. We should sanitize our hands frequently.
Most importantly, we should keep our distances. Recommended is six feet. This distance keeping among
humans is being called Social Distancing.
